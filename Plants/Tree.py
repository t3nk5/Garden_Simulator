class AppleTree(Plant):
    """
        A subclass of Plant representing an Apple Tree.
        This class simulates an Apple Tree, with specific requirements for water, light, and fertilizer.
        It grows over time, eventually producing seeds once it reaches the 'ADULT' maturity state.
        Attributes:
            FinaleState (FinaleState): The final state of the plant (whether it is dead, bloomed, or fructified).
            name (str): The name of the plant ("Apple Tree").
            maturity (Maturity): The current maturity state of the plant (e.g., seed, young, adult).
            actual_cut (int): Counter to track if the plant has been cut or not.
        Methods:
            give_water(water: int) -> None: Provides water to the plant if it is within the valid range.
            change_light(light: int) -> None: Provides light to the plant if it is within the valid range.
            add_fertilizer(fertilizer: int) -> None: Adds fertilizer to the plant if it is within the valid range.
            dead() -> None: Sets the plant's final state to dead and prints a message indicating the plant is dead.
            check_maturity() -> Optional[tuple[str, int]]: Checks if the plant has reached its final state and is ready to produce seeds.
            __str__() -> str: Returns a string representation of the plant's current state, including its growth, maturity, and health.
