class Salad(Plant):
    """
        A subclass of Plant representing a Salad plant.
        This class implements the specific behavior of a Salad plant, including water, light, and fertilizer
        requirements, growth speed, maturity checks, and handling of its final state (e.g., being dead or producing seeds).
        Attributes:
            FinaleState (FinaleState): The final state of the plant (whether it is dead or has bloomed).
            name (str): The name of the plant ("Salad").
            maturity (Maturity): The current maturity state of the plant (e.g., seed, young, adult).
        Methods:
            give_water(water: int) -> None: Provides water to the plant if it is within the valid range.
            change_light(light: int) -> None: Provides light to the plant if it is within the valid range.
            add_fertilizer(fertilizer: int) -> None: Adds fertilizer to the plant if it is within the valid range.
            dead() -> None: Sets the plant's final state to dead and notifies the user.
            check_maturity() -> Optional[tuple[str, int]]: Checks if the plant has reached its final state and is ready to produce seeds.
            __str__() -> str: Returns a string representation of the plant, including its growth, maturity, and health.
